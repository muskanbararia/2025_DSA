# Daily Data Structures Questions

Welcome to the **Daily Data Structures Questions** repository! This repository is a collection of data structure problems that I solve daily as part of my learning and practice journey. Each day, I solve one question, document the solution, and add it here for future reference and improvement.

## Folder Details
- **questions/**: Contains markdown files for each day. Each file includes:
  - The problem statement.
  - My approach to solving the problem.
  - The code solution (in my preferred language: Python).
  - Explanation of the code and time/space complexity analysis.

- **resources/**: Contains any helpful links, articles, or notes that aid my understanding of data structures.

## Daily Workflow
1. Pick a data structure problem to solve.
2. Solve the problem and write the solution in Python.
3. Document the question, approach, and analysis in a markdown file.
4. Commit and push the file to the repository.

## Goals
- Improve my understanding of data structures.
- Practice problem-solving regularly.
- Build a personal reference library of problems and solutions.

## How to Contribute
While this is primarily a personal repository, contributions are welcome! If you have:
- Suggestions for interesting problems.
- Feedback on my solutions or alternative approaches.

Feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.
